Secondary Treatment Technologies,Activated Sludge Process (ASP),"The activated sludge process is an aerobic-suspended growth-based biological process in which the activated sludge is used for the treatment of raw wastewater. The process mainly consists of three components, that are, an aeration tank, in which the raw wastewater is introduced and mixed with air in a continuous flow, plug flow, or tapered flow form of aeration, a secondary clarifier, in which, the activated solids are settled and separated from the treated wastewater, and RAS equipment to return the activated sludge back to the aeration tank and re-seed the incoming raw wastewater to obtain the desired concentration of MLSS (mixed liquor suspended solids), which is a mix of raw sewage and activated biological floc. When the desired concentration of MLSS is exceeded in the aeration tank, excess sludge is wasted from the system. The food to microorganisms (F/M) ratio is maintained in the system to prevent filamentous growth of microorganisms causing sludge bulking."
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR),"SBR technology is a modified version of ASP. SBR operates in batch mode and all the physical and biological processes take place in the same basin in a time-sequenced manner. This process takes place in four phases: filling, in which raw wastewater is filled in the basin in batch mode; reaction, in which, the air is supplied and mixed with the wastewater in the basin; settling, the solid and liquid phases are left to separate via settling, and; decanting, in which, the treated wastewater is drawn from the basin. A minimum of two basins are required for the operation of SBR, such that while one basin is in reaction phase, the other basin is in the settling phase and decanting. The process has higher efficiency due to better sludge settling characteristics. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A2O) Process,"A2O process is also a modified version of ASP which is primarily focused on enhancing nutrient (Nitrogen and Phosphorous) removal. The raw wastewater is firstly fed into the anaerobic tank, in which due to the absence of oxygen, the microorganisms begin to release phosphorous in the form of dissolved ortho-phosphates. The second tank is an anoxic tank, in which no oxygen is supplied and microorganisms start utilizing oxygen from nitrates present in the wastewater for energy. This nitrate is obtained when the ammoniacal-nitrogen present in the wastewater gets oxidized to nitrate form in the oxic tank and the nitrified liquid is recirculated back into the anoxic tank. Also, in the oxic tank, the dissolved ortho-phosphates are taken up by the active PAOs (Phosphate Accumulating Organisms) and converted to poly-phosphates which do not dissolve in water, these undissolved biomass is later drawn out through the secondary clarifier. Therefore, this process requires a sludge thickener. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Cyclic Activated Sludge Technology (C. Tech),"C. Tech is a modified version of SBR technology that operates in extended aeration mode. This technology was developed to make the operation of the technology simpler, control the nature of activated sludge in the reactor and promote phosphorous and nitrogen removal. The addition of a biological selector, automatization of technology using PLC system, monitoring of oxygen uptake rate, fine air bubble diffusers, and stainless-steel decanter are some features of C. Tech. The biological selector at the front end of the tank acts as an anoxic/anaerobic zone and facilitates the release of the phosphorous, it also eliminates the issue of sludge bulking due to low F/M and hence denser biological flocs are formed. When activated sludge is recycled to the selector zone, a low oxygen condition is encountered, this leads to the uptake of phosphates by PAOs. The removal of organic matter takes place in the aeration phase and the oxygen uptake is monitored using a PLC system. Upon decrease in oxygen concentration below defined levels, oxygen is supplied so as to prevent the proliferation of filamentous micro-organisms. The excess sludge is wasted from the system using pumps."
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Biological Filtration and Oxygenated Reactor (BIOFOR),"BIOFOR process is an aerobic attached growth treatment method. It is employed for achieving a high degree removal of organic matter, suspended solids, and nitrogen concentration. The process comprises an enhanced primary densadeg clarifier that facilitates optimal flocculation, tube settling, sludge thickening, and primary sludge recirculation. The effluent from the densadeg clarifier is introduced at the bottom of the reactor, which moves upwards through the biolite media characterized by high surface area. The filter media expands with the upward flow and the fixed film biomass decomposes the organic matter present in the wastewater. The air diffusers, at the bottom of the reactor, supply oxygen to keep optimal conditions for biomass growth, also facilitating higher contact and retention. It does not require a secondary clarifier and offers a better economy of space and high performance. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,High Rate Activated Sludge BIOFOR-F Technology,"BIOFOR-F is a highly sophisticated and mechanized treatment process. Although it is similar to BIOFOR in the sense that it employs biological filtration combined with aeration, it does not require primary clarifier but an aerated grit chamber, tapered air diffusion in the aeration tank, followed by secondary clarifier, and utilizes a dual media filter for biological filtration with co-current aeration. The process also includes an elaborate sludge management process, where, the temperature of the sludge digester is maintained for maintaining proper anaerobic conditions, the contents of the digester are mixed using biogas, and dissolved air floatation is utilized for concentration of sludge. Using gas engines, electrical and thermal energy are co-generated in the system dynamically. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Soil Biotechnology (SBT),"SBT is also referred to as Constructed Sand Filter (CSF) technology. It can be constructed of RCC, stone masonry or soil bunds and utilizes gravel, pebbles, sand, or rocks as filter media. This technology utilizes natural physical, chemical, and biological processes such as filtration, sedimentation, respiration, photosynthesis, bacteriological degradation for the removal of organic matter and nitrogen present in wastewater. The process also utilizes a combination of cultured micro and macro-organisms for the treatment. The technology consists of different layers of filtration media and the influent wastewater is made to flow from top to bottom layers.  While flowing through the media, the cultured biomass degrades the organic matter, the mineral composition of the filter media maintains pH in the system, the earthworms cultured for the system maintain the oxygen level, and no sludge but vermicompost is produced at the end of the process. The plants planted in the top layer of the SBT act as bio-indicators, whose photosynthesis assures proper functioning of the system beneath. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Constructed Wetlands (CW),"Constructed wetlands technology refers to a submerged artificial system that mimics wetlands of natural origin. Firstly, the water slowly enters the system leading to the settlement of large particles, the roots of plant species take up nutrients from the system, the filter media removes the large particles and the substrate attached to the media degrades the organic matter. The constructed wetlands produce high-quality effluents and they can be used both as secondary technology or tertiary technology. Based on the direction of flow, the constructed wetlands can be divided into the horizontal flow constructed wetlands (HFCW) and vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCW). Wetlands are natural processes similar to stabilization ponds. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Waste Stabilization Pond (WSP),"Waste stabilization ponds are artificial earthen structures constructed for the biological treatment of raw wastewater. This method has a higher detention period and produces good quality effluent which can be used for irrigation, aquaculture, or safe for discharge into the river system. It employs three types of ponds, each utilizing a different kind of microorganisms for removing organic matter. Firstly, the raw wastewater is led into the anaerobic pond that has a higher depth and lower surface area, anaerobic decomposition takes place in this pond and the sludge produced is sent to drying beds. The effluent from the anaerobic pond is fed into the facultative pond which has a higher surface area and comparatively lesser depth than the anaerobic pond, promoting sunlight, to penetrate into the pond, and facultative microorganisms to decompose the organic matter. Thereafter, the wastewater enters the maturation pond that has complete aerobic conditions and aerobic microorganisms actively decompose the organic matter, producing very little sludge and high-quality effluent is obtained at the end. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Duckweed Pond System (DPS),"The duckweed pond system is an artificial earthen structure-based technology that utilizes thick layer of duckweed plants for the removal of organic matter and nutrients. To reduce the effect of wind and waves on the functioning of the pond, it is divided into cells with the help of bamboo or other materials. The ponds are shallower and the top layers act as facultative pond while the lower layer functions as an anaerobic pond. It has a larger detention time and proper management of the plants is required for optimum functioning of the system. The harvested duckweed plants are used as fish feed due to large protein content."
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR),"The moving bed biofilm reactor utilizes patented plastic media in suspension form under aerobic conditions for the treatment of wastewater. It is a type of attached growth process in which the biomass grown on the media surface decomposes the organic matter present in the wastewater. The plastic media, lighter in weight, has the tendency to float, and hence the downward mixing is facilitated with the help of air diffusers mounted on sides of the reactor. The nitrification process is carried out by the biomass on the outer surface of the media while the inner zone of the biomass attached to the media exists in the anoxic phase and carries out denitrification."
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Membrane Bioreactor (MBR),"A membrane bioreactor utilizes patented microfiltration membranes in the size range of 0.1 to 0.4 µm. The biomass exists in suspension form and the separation between the liquid phase and solid phase is obtained through the membrane. The membrane bioreactor (MBR) process is a combination of activated sludge process and membrane separation process. Low pressure membranes (ultrafiltration or microfiltration) are commonly used. Membranes can be submerged in the biological reactor or located in a separate stage or compartment and are used for liquid-solid separation instead of the usual settling process. Primary sedimentation tank, final sedimentation tank and disinfection facilities are not installed in this process. The reaction tanks comprise an anoxic tank and an aerobic tank, and the membrane modules are immersed in the aerobic tank. Pre-treated, screened influent enters the membrane bioreactor, where biodegradation takes place. The mixed liquor is withdrawn by water head difference or suction pump through membrane modules in a reaction tank, being filtered and separated into biosolids and liquid. Surfaces of the membrane are continuously washed down during operation by the mixed flow of air and liquid generated by air diffusers installed at the bottom of the reaction tank.  "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Trickling Filter,"The trickling filter technology is the most basic form of an aerobic attached growth process. It utilized pebbles, gravels, rocks, or brick stones, organized in the form of a honeycomb structure for proper natural aeration, as filter media on which biomass growth takes place. The raw wastewater passing through the filter experiences mechanical straining and biological decomposition. After the biomass layer attached to the media thickens, the inner layer of biomass become anaerobic in nature due to lack of air penetration and subsequently gets sloughed due to the hydraulic loading rate. This process is referred to as sloughing. A clarifier is employed in this system for the removal of such sloughed biomass. Trickling filters were modified to increase the efficacy by recirculating the treated effluent back to the filter for higher organic removal. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Submerged Aerated Fixed Film (SAFF),"SAFF technology involves a two-stage biological oxidation process in which submerged plastic media is used to form an externally aerated submerged fixed media trickling filter, providing a higher void ratio and surface area for biomass growth and organic matter removal. This technology works on longer solid retention time and under low F/M conditions. It does not require PST and digesters for sludge. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASB) + Extended Aeration (EA),"The upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor is a suspended growth process in which the influent is directed into the reactor from the bottom, which agitates the settled activated sludge blanket in the reactor causing mixing and removal of organic matter from the system. The technology, therefore, does not require external equipment for mixing the sludge with the influent and leads to energy savings. The effluent is withdrawn from the reactor from the top portion while the gas produced is also collected. Since UASB is an anaerobic process, the effluent is unstable in nature and has high immediate oxygen demand, this makes it unfit for release into the river system. Hence, the reactor is followed by an aeration tank which operates in extended aeration mode and stabilizes the effluent obtained. The biomass in the extended aeration phase is in the endogenous respiration phase (low F/M and high air supply) and leads to stabilized sludge formation, which is further settled in the secondary clarifier. "
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Oxidation Pond,"The oxidation pond method is employed in places where land availability is not a constraint. It operates in extended aeration mode and comprises a long oval channel, earthen or made up of RCC, or brick, along with external equipment for aeration (brush aerators) across the channel surface. The cross-section of the ditch is trapezoidal to maintain uniform velocity. The aerators provide a horizontal drift to the wastewater causing mixing of sludge with wastewater. They do not require a PST but a clarifier is required for sludge removal. They are characterized by long detention periods."
Secondary Treatment Technologies,Anaerobic Lagoon followed by Stabilization Pond (SP),"This technology combination utilizes the same principle as UASB + extended aeration combination. The stabilization pond is employed after the anaerobic pond to stabilize the effluent produced from the anaerobic lagoon. The anaerobic lagoon process is used to decompose the organic matter present in wastewater anaerobically while flowing through an earthen basin. The basin is deeper, facilitating sedimentation and digestion of sludge. The effluent produced is very unstable and is followed by a stabilization pond which provides aerobic conditions for the stabilization of the effluent."
Emerging Technologies,Modified Ludzack Ettinger Process (MLE),"The modified Ludzack-Ettinger process employs an anoxic zone followed by an aerobic zone for the removal of organic matter, nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia. In this process, firstly, the ammonia present in the wastewater is nitrified in the aerobic basin, and then the nitrified liquor is recirculated into the anoxic basin, fixed with mixers, for the denitrification process. This process is followed by a clarifier for the removal of sludge and has high N removal efficiency."
Emerging Technologies,Bardenpho Process,"The bardenpho process consists of a 4-stage system in which the first two stages are similar to the MLE process, followed by a third stage which is an anoxic zone, and finally a re-aeration zone. The first two stages, as seen for the MLE process (anoxic, aerobic, recirculation), can effectively reduce carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Additional stages are employed in this process, to facilitate phosphorus removal and nitrogen removal to very low concentrations. The third zone is provided to denitrify the nitrified liquor which could not be recirculated to the first zone. In this stage, carbon is used as the electron donor while the nitrate present in the wastewater is utilized as the electron acceptor. Often, the C/N ratio decreases till this stage, and external carbon source addition is required for effective denitrification. The last zone of re-aeration is provided to balance the lost DO in the wastewater, facilitate phosphorus removal, and stripping of nitrogen still left in the wastewater. "
Emerging Technologies,Step-feed BNR Process,"The step-feed BNR process comprises several anoxic-oxic stages. It follows the principle of the proportionate influent introduction at each stage and recirculation of sludge to the first stage, for higher SRT and better removal efficiency. The denitrification process is carried out in the anoxic zones when the nitrified liquor from the oxic zone is recycled to the anoxic zone while carbon, N, and P removal take place in the oxic zones. "
Emerging Technologies,Wuhrmann Process,"The wuhrmann process is also referred to as a post-denitrification process. In this process, a single stage system consisting of the following zone sequence, aerobic zone, anoxic zone and another aeration zone is employed. This method also employs a secondary clarifier from which the sludge is recirculated to the head of the basin. The last aeration zone is provided to make up for the low C/N ratio and increase the DO concentration in the effluent and sludge so that efficient denitrification is achieved in the anoxic zone. But it also leads to the problem of loss of nitrified effluent from the clarifier leading to lesser N removal efficiency. In MLE process, anoxic zone is placed before oxic zone to address this problem of low carbon availability and to achieve high N removal efficiency. "
Tertiary Treatment Technologies,Coagulation + Flocculation + Rapid Sand Filters (RSF),"Coagulation and flocculation processes are used in combination to remove fine suspended and colloidal particles, which cannot be removed through the normal settling process. A suitable coagulant is dosed to the influent and rapidly mixed to disperse the coagulant throughout the influent. Later, under the flocculation process, gentle mixing is done to promote the formation of flocs, this influent is then passed through the rapid sand filter which subsequently removes the finely dispersed and colloidal particles through mechanical straining. This process is often utilized for polishing purposes."
Tertiary Treatment Technologies,Microfiltration/ Ultrafiltration and Reverse Osmosis (MF/UF + RO),"Membrane filtration is employed to achieve high quality effluent, requiring low concentrations of total dissolved solids, suspended solids, inorganic solids or organic solids. These are costlier than other tertiary processes but are high performing in nature. Different membranes correspond to the removal of different sizes of particles, microfiltration (0.1 to 5 micrometer), ultrafiltration (0.005-0.1 micrometer), and reverse osmosis (0.1-1 nanometer) are discussed. Microfiltration can remove particles in the range of 0.1 to 5 µm. Impurities, pathogens, and several other particulates fall in this range. In this process, through a microporous membrane, the influent is passed under low pressure, leading to removal of contaminants. Similarly, in ultrafiltration, through a permeable membrane, influent is passed to separate suspended solids having sizes greater 0.005-0.1 µm. Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes are dense skin, asymmetric or composite membranes that let water get through and reject almost all salts. It uses a semi-permeable membrane to pass the influent under pressure so as to let very small particles only to pass. The pressure applied to force the separation of salts in this process is referred as osmotic pressure. This process however leads to high rejection volume, which needs to be re-treated and may require extra equipment or set-up."
