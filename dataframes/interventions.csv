"Promotion of natural ways to conserve water resources, such as, rain-water harvesting",Spread awareness about water scarcity and the need to utilise reclaimed water
Strict Monitoring of effluent discharge from nearby industries,Address safety concerns related to reclaimed water to public to enhance acceptability
Regular monitoring of quality of water,Assess reclaimed water demand in the city and the potential reuse purposes
Prevention of land encroachment activities,Prescribe strict quality criteria for each reuse purpose
Check over-exploitation of groundwater resource,Government should recognise the need to switch to reclaimed water reclamation
Develop R&D  to explore newer potential sources of water,Government should launch strict policies and regulations promoting water reclamation
Prevent social and economic activities in the vicinity of the source to curb pollution,New STP installations or upgradation of existing STPs should be done to ensure safe quality of reclaimed water
Economic diversification is suggested to assure income,"Disinfection of reclaimed water should be done, dosing should prevent future recontamination"
"Accurate estimation of vulnerable groups, their profiles and locations","Proper land, energy and fund allocation should be done to enhance preparedness against water scarcity "
Industries should be strictly directed to adhere to prescribed quality standards for effluent discharge,Environmental sustainability of STPs should be done
The infrastrcuture should be climate-resilient and scope for expansion should be incorporated,"Material, chemical and nutrient recovery potentials should be harnessed"
Reuse of wastewater/ treated wastewater should be promoted,Water harvesting techniques should be promoted and well-adopted
Spread awareness about water scarcity,The post-distribution network for distribution of reclaimed water throughout the city should be designed carefully
Water metering is suggested to curb over-use,There should exist scope for future expansion in the existing gfacilities
Water lossess should be checked,An integrated wastewater treatment and reuse network should be designed to assure water sufficiency
A circular economy in terms of water usage should be achieved,The vulnerable areas should be given high preference in terms of water supply
None,Always keep a track of the water demand potential of the city during normal and peak hours
None,Install storage and balancing reservoirs to address peak demands or supply disruptions
None,The number of STPs installed in the city should be increased
None,The performance of STPs should be strictly monitored.
None,The technological installations in STPs should be cost-effective and high performing even in un-favourable weather conditions.
